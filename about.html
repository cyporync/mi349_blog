                        Hi, I'm Claire Cyporyn. I am a senior at Michigan State University majoring in Computer Science
                        with
                        a minor
                        in
                        Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. My cognate area of focus is Media and
                        Information. I'm passionate about my field because I love problem solving and
                        coming up with creative solutions. I enjoy designing and building both the frontend and the
                        backend
                        of applications. I currently work for the State of Michigan in the Department of Technology,
                        Management, and Budget as a
                        student cybersecurity analyst.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, practicing yoga, listening to music, seeing my friends,
                        reading, and writing. I like to collect CDs. I also like to cook, and I enjoy trying
                        new recipes.
                    </p>
